# php-bitfinex-v2
PHP Bitfinex API (v2)

This is still a work in progress. 
I'll be gradually adding all the v2 functions and eventually expand this into an informational page with graphs and indicators... possibly write a bot algorithm to go with it!
A full list of additional JSON array items can be found here: https://docs.bitfinex.com/v2/reference

Requirements:
- A Bitfinex account with an API Key and Secret enabled.
- A server that runs PHP (duh.).
- Read example.php for a basic understanding.
